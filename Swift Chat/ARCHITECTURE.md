# Swift Chat Architecture

This document outlines the architectural decisions made during the refactoring of the Swift Chat application.

## MVVM Architecture

The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern:

- **Models**: Data structures like `Message` that represent the core data entities
- **Views**: SwiftUI components that display UI elements and handle user interaction
- **ViewModels**: Classes like `ChatViewModel` that handle business logic and data transformation

## Directory Structure

```
Swift Chat/
├── Models/               # Data models
├── Views/                # UI components
├── ViewModels/           # Business logic
├── Utils/                # Utility classes
└── Extensions/           # Swift extensions
```

## Component Interactions

1. User interacts with `ChatView`
2. `ChatView` delegates actions to `ChatViewModel`
3. `ChatViewModel` updates the data (messages)
4. UI reactively updates based on changes to the ViewModel's published properties

## Design Patterns

### Dependency Injection

ViewModels are injected into Views to allow for testability and separation of concerns.

### Protocol-Oriented Programming

Using protocols like `KeyboardReadable` to implement common functionality through protocol extensions.

### Observer Pattern

Using Combine's `@Published` properties and SwiftUI's reactive updating to respond to state changes.

### Composition over Inheritance

UI components are designed for reusability through composition rather than inheritance.

## Performance Considerations

- Memory management with proper use of weak references in closures
- Efficient UI rendering with optimized SwiftUI views
- Appropriate use of animation to maintain smooth UX

## Accessibility

- Proper text sizes and contrasts
- VoiceOver compatibility with labeled elements
- Keyboard navigation support

## Future Improvements

- Integration with an actual backend service
- User authentication
- Message persistence with Core Data or other storage solutions
- Media attachment support
- Localization for multiple languages
